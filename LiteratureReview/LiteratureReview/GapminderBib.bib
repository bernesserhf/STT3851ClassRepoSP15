	abstract = {Historically, a sectoral approach (based on the industrial, transportation, commercial, and residential sectors) has shaped the way we frame and analyze issues of energy conservation and {CO}2 mitigation. This sectoral categorization, however, is limited in its capacity to reveal the total impacts of consumer activities on energy use and its related environmental impacts. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm, called the Consumer Lifestyle Approach ({CLA}), to explore the relationship between consumer activities and environmental impacts in the {US}. Estimates based on our methodology reveal that more than 80\% of the energy used and the {CO}2 emitted in the {US} are a consequence of consumer demands and the economic activities to support these demands. Direct influences due to consumer activities (home energy use and personal travel) are 4\% of the {US} {GDP}, but account for 28\% and 41\% of {US} energy use and {CO}2 emissions, respectively. Indirect influences (such as housing operations, transportation operations, food, and apparel) involve more than twice the direct energy use and {CO}2 emissions. Characterization of both direct and indirect energy use and emissions is critical to the design of more effective energy and {CO}2 emission policies. It may also help erode the false dichotomy of “them versus us” (industrial polluters versus consumers) references to the locus of responsibility for control of energy use and {CO}2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Gender inequalities in Internet use are smaller among younger people. It is unclear whether these differences can be explained by the varying circumstances in which different generations grew up or by other factors that vary within an individual’s life time. This article tests a model which proposes that generation determines the level of Internet use and life stage determines gender differences in Internet use. Descriptive analyses of a representative sample of 1,578 British Internet users confirm that there continue to be small but significant gender differences for most uses of the Internet. The findings from a series of linear regressions suggest that gender differences vary for different life stages related to occupation and marital status. This is true especially for typically male uses. The article concludes that other factors related to life stage will continue to influence gender differences in Internet use in the future.},

	abstract = {To identify the determinants of cross-country disparities in personal computer and Internet penetration, we examine a panel of 161 countries over the 1999-2001 period. Our candidate variables include economic variables (income per capita, years of schooling, illiteracy, trade openness), demographic variables (youth and aged dependency ratios, urbanization rate), infrastructure indicators (telephone density, electricity consumption), telecommunications pricing measures, and regulatory quality. With the exception of trade openness and the telecom pricing measures, these variables enter in as statistically significant in most specifications for computer use. A similar pattern holds true for Internet use, except that telephone density and aged dependency matter less. The global digital divide is mainly – but by no means entirely – accounted for by income differentials. For computers, telephone density and regulatory quality are of second and third importance, while for the Internet, this ordering is reversed. The region specific explanations for large disparities in computer and Internet penetration are generally very similar. Our results suggest that public investment in human capital, telecommunications infrastructure, and the regulatory infrastructure can mitigate the gap in {PC} and Internet use.},

	abstract = {Over the 1970s and 1980s, emissions of carbon dioxide from energy use fell in per capita, per unit {GDP}, and in some cases in absolute terms in 10 industrialized countries studied by {LBNL}. These declines were driven principally by falling end-use energy intensities and the decreasing carbon content of energy. By the early 1990s, however, a slowdown in the decline of intensities and the continued growth of {GDP} and energy services activity have reversed the trends in absolute emissions. {LBNL} concludes that {CO}2 emissions will continue to rise in the future unless energy intensities and/or the carbon content of energy can be decreased at an accelerated rate via policy changes, technological innovation and/or behavioural adaptation.},

	abstract = {Urban areas contain 40\% of the population and contribute 75\% of the Chinese national economy. Thus, a better understanding of urban energy uses is necessary for Chinese decision-makers at various levels to address energy security, climate change mitigation, and local pollution abatement. Therefore, this paper addresses three key questions: What is the urban contribution to China's energy usage and {CO}2 emissions? What is the contribution of large cities, and what alternate energy–economy pathways are they following? How have energy uses and {CO}2 emissions transformed in the last two decades in key Chinese cities? This three-tier analysis illustrates the changes in urban energy uses and {CO}2 emissions in China. The results show that the urban contributions make up 84\% of China's commercial energy usage. The 35 largest cities in China, which contain 18\% of the population, contribute 40\% of China's energy uses and {CO}2 emissions. In four provincial cities, the per capita energy usage and {CO}2 emissions have increased several-fold. Rapid progress was made in reducing the carbon intensity of economic activities in cities throughout the 1990s, but alarmingly, such progress has either slowed down or been reversed in the last few years. These results have important policy implications.},

	abstract = {The direct electricity used by data centers has become an important issue in recent years as demands for new Internet services (such as search, music downloads, video-on-demand, social networking, and telephony) have become more widespread. This study estimates historical electricity used by data centers worldwide and regionally on the basis of more detailed data than were available for previous assessments, including electricity used by servers, data center communications, and storage equipment. Aggregate electricity use for data centers doubled worldwide from 2000 to 2005. Three quarters of this growth was the result of growth in the number of the least expensive (volume) servers. Data center communications and storage equipment each contributed about 10\% of the growth. Total electricity use grew at an average annual rate of 16.7\% per year, with the Asia Pacific region (without Japan) being the only major world region with growth significantly exceeding that average. Direct electricity used by information technology equipment in data centers represented about 0.5\% of total world electricity consumption in 2005. When electricity for cooling and power distribution is included, that figure is about 1\%. Worldwide data center power demand in 2005 was equivalent (in capacity terms) to about seventeen 1000 {MW} power plants.},
